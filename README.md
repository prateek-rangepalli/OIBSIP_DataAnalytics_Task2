# OIBSIP_DataAnalytics_Task2

## 📌 Project Title
Customer Segmentation Analysis

## 📖 Objective
The goal of this project is to perform customer segmentation using clustering algorithms. Segmentation helps businesses understand different customer groups, target marketing strategies, and improve decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset
- Features include customer age, annual income, and spending score.
- Target: Identify natural clusters of customers without predefined labels.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Preprocessed data (handled missing values, normalized features).
3. Applied **KMeans Clustering** to segment customers.
4. Determined optimal number of clusters using **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**.
5. Visualized customer clusters using scatter plots.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🎯 Outcome
- Customers grouped into distinct clusters based on income and spending behavior.
- Example insights:
  - Cluster 0: High income, high spending → Potential premium customers.
  - Cluster 1: Low income, low spending → Budget-sensitive customers.
  - Cluster 2: Young age, moderate spending → Growth opportunity group.
- Business applications: Targeted promotions, loyalty programs, retention strategies.
